Sample of C Programming:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    // Single Line comment
    printf("Hello, Krithvika!");
    /*
    multi line comment 
    this 
    is the body.
    */
    return 0;
}

Different parts of C programming:
*Pre-Processing
*HeaderFile
*Function
*Variable
*Statements & Expressions
*Comments

Pre-Processing:
--------------
#include is the first word of any programming language. it's also called pre processor, the task of pre-processing is to initialize the environment of the program. this tell the header with the program file is required.

so, when we say #include <stdio.h> we are telling the compiler to include the studio.h

Header file:
------------
they are some predefined functions which can be directly used by by our program, They come with #include before them.
ex: if you want to use printf(''); Then you should use #include <stdio.h> is required.

Main() Function:
-----------------
Every C program starting point, Every thing inside the main will get executed.

Comment:
--------
complier omitted code.
Return:
-------
return statement is meant to define the end of any C program. if the extension of the file is not c then the compler will never recognize as c language.
